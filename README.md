# Level 0 - "Tutorial Level"

"If you're not careful and you noclip out of reality in the wrong areas, you'll end up in the Backrooms, where it's nothing but the stink of old moist carpet, the madness of mono-yellow, the endless background noise of fluorescent lights at maximum hum-buzz, and approximately six hundred million square miles of randomly segmented empty rooms to be trapped in. God save you if you hear something wandering around nearby, because it sure as hell has heard youâ€¦"

Level 0 is the original part of the Backrooms creepypasta, but now there are more than 1000 levels!
It is safe and completely devoid of life.

## Map

Level 0 is a randomly generated large area made out of smaller rooms which are randomly chosen.
The floor is made of carpet and the ceiling made of office ceiling material idk.
The walls are made of a yellowed wallpaper.

## Hallucinations

Randomly between 1 and 10 minutes the sound of the lights get louder and louder until it suddently becomes silent

## Entities

No entities are known to exist within the level.

## Exits

Noclip through the ground at a specific location to enter Level 1

# Level 1 - "Habitable Zone"

Level 1 is a large empty Warehouse with concrete walls, floors, ceiling and metal pipes.
This level, again, is completely safe and has no known entites.

## Map

In the map you will find a lot of concrete pillars with lights and smaller hallways leading to more of the warehouse.

## Hallucinations

Looking at the ceiling too long will make its texture warp.
This hallucination may happen with more materials but the ceiling is the only known case of this happening.

## Entities

No entities are known to exist within the level.

## Exits

Walk acrosss and extended hallway to find the door leading to level 2

# Level 2 - "Abondoned Utility Halls" or how I like to call it "Pipe Dreams"

Level 2 was once regarded to be one of the main levels of the backrooms.
This level, while having a low entity count, is very unsafe and should be exited as fast as possible.

## Map

Level 2 is an infinite array of Euclidian yet complex maintence tunnels that once had various uses.

## Hallucinations

There are no known records of hallucinations in the level.

## Entities

Every 15 - 120 seconds an entity known as "red mouth" may spawn near the player. 
The name is a reference to the original model before the redesign only having a big red mouth in its face. 
Now it only has two red glowing eyes.

## Exits

While walking across hallways you may find doors some of which are unlocked and may lead to Level 1, Level 3 or maybe even Level 4.
Most doors will lead to more long corridors with some leading to dead ends.
